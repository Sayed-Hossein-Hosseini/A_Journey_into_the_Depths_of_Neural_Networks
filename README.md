# A_Journey_into_the_Depths_of_Neural_Networks
The goal of this exercise is to build and train a neural network from scratch (without using any pre-built libraries) to classify color images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This exercise will proceed step by step to ultimately gain an understanding of convolutional networks.
