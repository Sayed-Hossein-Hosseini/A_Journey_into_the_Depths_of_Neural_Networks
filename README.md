This repository chronicles an immersive, step-by-step expedition into the fascinating world of neural networks. Starting from the fundamental building block‚Äîthe single neuron‚Äîwe progressively construct and demystify complex architectures, culminating in the implementation of powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch. Each Jupyter notebook herein represents a distinct milestone in this learning odyssey, meticulously detailing concepts and code. All custom neural network components are built from scratch using NumPy, while the advanced CNN segment leverages the efficiency and capabilities of PyTorch.

The **CIFAR-10 dataset** serves as the primary proving ground for all models developed throughout this project.

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file is the preferred method. Create one with the following, then install:
    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    tensorflow
    scikit-learn
    torch
    torchvision
    jupyter
    ```
    Install using:
